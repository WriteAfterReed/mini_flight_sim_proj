# mini_flight_sim_proj

This is a mini flight sim project using webgl.

The point is to generate terrian to generate a 3D using [dimaond square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm).

Then with a bit of webgl and a bit of JS we make a camera view that moves around!
 
Just open the index.html file and it ships.
